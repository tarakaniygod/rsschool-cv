## About me:

   Hello everyone, my name is Roma. I'm 22. I want to become a web developer. I graduated from the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation in 2022. Hobbies include playing the guitar, reading books, studying. I've been learning web development for about a year, but I'm doing it very slowly. I know the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js and etc.

## Code example:

   I don't know what code to include here, so I'll just point out a piece of code from the training projects.

   ```
   function animatePress (userChosenColour){
        $("#" + userChosenColour).addClass("pressed");
        setTimeout(function(){
            $("#" + userChosenColour).removeClass("pressed"); 
        }, 100);

    }
    animatePress(userChosenColour);
    checkAnswer(userClickedPattern.length-1);
    });

   ```
